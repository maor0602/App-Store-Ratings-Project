# 📱 App Store Ratings Analysis Project

## 🌟 Overview
This project analyzes app store data from 2008 to 2019 to uncover trends and actionable insights related to app performance. Key factors investigated include app size, age rating, and in-app purchase offerings. The analysis aims to help developers optimize user satisfaction and improve app development strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and processing
  - `matplotlib`: Creating visualizations
  - `seaborn`: Enhancing visualizations
- **SQL**: Querying and filtering data for analysis
- **Tableau**: Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- **Release Date**: The launch date of each app.
- **Price**: Whether the app is free or paid.
- **In-App Purchases**: Availability of additional paid features or content.
- **Age Rating**: Minimum recommended age for users.
- **Size**: The storage space required by the app.
- **Genre**: Category of the app.
- **Ratings**: User feedback ratings categorized as high, medium, or low.

## 🎯 Goals
- Determine how app size impacts user satisfaction.
- Explore the effect of in-app purchases on ratings.
- Analyze the correlation between age rating and user satisfaction.
- Provide actionable recommendations for app developers.

## 📈 Key Findings
1. **App Size**:
   - Larger apps (e.g., games and multimedia apps) had significantly higher ratings, with 58.18% rated highly, compared to 36.81% for smaller apps.
   - Smaller apps had a higher proportion of low ratings, suggesting potential performance or content issues.

2. **In-App Purchases**:
   - Free apps with in-app purchases received better ratings (57.06% high ratings) compared to free apps without in-app purchases (45.45% high ratings).
   - However, for paid apps, those without in-app purchases performed better, suggesting users prefer a one-time payment model for premium apps.

3. **Age Ratings**:
   - Apps for younger audiences (4+, 9+, 12+) generally received higher ratings than those targeting older audiences (17+), indicating simpler and engaging content is preferred by younger users.

## 💡 Recommendations
- **Small Apps**: Focus on improving quality and performance to reduce dissatisfaction.
- **In-App Purchases**: For free apps, enhance the value of in-app purchases to boost satisfaction. For paid apps, consider avoiding in-app purchases to maintain a premium user experience.
- **Age-Specific Improvements**: Invest in engaging content for younger audiences while improving quality for apps targeted at older users.
